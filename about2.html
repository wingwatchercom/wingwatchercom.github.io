            website was born in May of 2002 after a vacation to sunny Florida. 
            I bought my first digital camera down there and brought back many 
            bird photos. My sister, Cathi (deceased now), offered to help me build 
            a website to house my photos. After a learning process, we both designed 
            and formatted the original Wing Watchers.com and things were great. 
            Over the last 4 years the site has evolved into the version that you 
            will visit, now. I have learned to do webmaster chores like adding 
            new content, fresh links, and making my own page backgrounds. I hope 
            you will enjoy and learn something from all the effort and devotion 
            that the Wing Watchers Crew puts into this site.<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Once you click on the "ENTER" button on the front page, 
            you will be wisked away to a page of menus and a very cool environmental 
            newsfeed, updated regularly. Deeper into the site you will be presented 
            with a special page for the kids with many fun things to do and visit, also a large volume of bird, insect, animal, and wild and domestic 
            flower photos. Just follow the simple directions on each photo page 
            and the navigation system is easy. We won't let you get lost!!! All 
            of the bird photos have a clickable name tag that will bring up an 
            inline box with descriptions of that species. This is all possible 
            because of free content allowed by</font> <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><a href="http://www.enature.com/">eNature.com</a>.</font></i><br><br><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;After the main menus of photographs, there is a link to more important pages on our site. You will find some great Nature Poetry, all the references that we use, a whole page of links to other related websites, and a slide show with some odd photos (non-nature).</font></i></p>
