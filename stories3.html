<FONT FACE="VERDANA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" COLOR="#FEEDD6"> Wing Watchers would like to entertain you, with an occasional short story or observation of the funny but interesting things that have happened to us during our quest to observe birds and nature. These are true Tales and are given to you, perhaps, to enjoy or even help you relate to a natural happening of your own observations. This section will be updated with a new story or observation as they happen for us. That's the beauty of Mother Nature, you never know what will happen next. Happy observing.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>

It was a regular morning at our cabin, all sunny and clear. The early morning sounds and smells blended in with our freshly made coffee. Judy, Jodie, and I sat looking out the window where our bird feeders and Hummingbird feeders are. It looked like another feeding frenzy was under way, as usual. It's simply amazing how these little flying machines never crash into each other as they dive in and out from one feeder to the next.Then, the unthinkable happened so quickly that our hearts started pounding as we hurried out the door. A tiny male Ruby-throated Hummingbird had just slammed into the window that we were watching out of.<BR><BR><BR>

                    We found the poor little guy on the ground, right under the window. His wing was spread out as if it were broken and his eyes were closed up tightly. It didn't look too good for this bird, he just wasn't moving. Judy picked the Hummer up into her hand to see if there was anything that could be done to help it. He wouldn't respond!<BR><BR>    Not knowing if it would work, I reached over and started stroking the pipsqueak's back, gently. I figured maybe a strange touch would arouse his instinct to survive and he would be ok. Apparently this was a lucky guess because he started moving a little and soon was able to crawl to another part of Judy's hand.<BR><BR><BR>

                    We were all thrilled to see this event turn around for the better but we still worried about it's wing. It wasn't broken after all, the little guy started moving his wings and body around, slowly but surely. He started looking pretty good so Judy walked him over to one of our Hummingbird feeders and eased the bird onto the perch. The little Hummer sat there for quite awhile, we could tell that he was still pretty dazed from his misadventure. After 15 minutes or so, he bent forward and took a sip from one of the yellow flowers on the feeder. And then, as if nothing had ever happened, he flew off.<BR><BR><BR>

                    Here is a little tip from the author: If you have feeders up around your house, try putting a few decals or tape any paper object to the window. The birds only see a reflection, in the window, of what is behind them. When frightened or moving through the feeding frenzy, they're likely to mistake what their eyes tell them and BAMM! The objects on the window will break up the reflection enough for the bird to recognize the danger.<BR><BR><BR></FONT>                                                              <CENTER><IMG SRC="images/humm5.jpg" WIDTH="420" HEIGHT="370" ALT="That was a close call."></CENTER><BR><BR>
